# Backend CloudX

This repository contains the backend services for the cloudX project, following a microservices architecture. Each microservice is organized in its own folder within this repository.

## Structure
- **product-service/**: Product Service microservice (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, AWS CDK)
- (Add more microservices here as the project grows)

## Monorepo Approach
- All backend microservices are managed in a single repository for easier collaboration and version control, as per assignment requirements.
- Each service is developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Technologies Used
- **AWS CDK (TypeScript)**: Infrastructure as code
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints
- **Jest**: Unit testing

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the desired microservice folder (e.g., `product-service/`).
2. Follow the README in that folder for setup and deployment instructions.
